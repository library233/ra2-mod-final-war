   1.  Multiplayer Map Full Tutorial  </p>
	<p>
	Let’s make your first multiplayer map for Red Alert 2! This map will teach you how to make bridges, water and cliffs. 
<br><br>
<b><i>Step 1: Start Creating A Map</i><br></b>
After starting FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge(tm), click on File->New. Click on OK twice. In the last dialog box, enter 50 x 50 as your size. Cllick OK. FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge(tm) will now load graphics and prepare the map. After FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> has finished, you’ll see your (empty) map.
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 2: Make A Cliff</i><br></b>
We will make a cliff at the bottom left of the map. To do this, we can use the cliff painting tools (the first 2 green icons in the bar). First we’ll make the back of the cliffs. Select the second tool, move your mouse where you want the cliff top to be (we’ll call this point A), hold down the mouse button and move it to the bottom right. Now click on point A and move your mouse to the bottom left (this is point B). Now hold down the mouse button once more and move the mouse to the right bottom. The result should be something similar to this:
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 3: Finish The Cliff</i><br></b>
We still need the front of the cliff. To paint it, we just use the front cliff-painting tool (this is the first tool). This step is very similar to <i>Step 2</i>. Drag the cliffs from A to B, from C to D, and from D to E. The result should be similar to this:<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_1.jpg"><br><br>

<b><i>Step 4: Level Out The Cliff</i><br></b>
As you now see, our cliff has some white squares in it. This is because the RA2 maps are 3d maps. First, you should use the AutoLevel tool (the third tool in the bar). Just click on it. You will now see something like this:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_2.jpg"><br>As you see, it looks much better now but it is not yet correct. To make it completely flat, we use the flatten terrain tool (the third icon in the bar). Select the tool, hold down the mouse button at A and move the mouse to B. Now, just flatten the whole cliff until it looks like this (be aware that you can use the brush size in the toolbar to do this faster):<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_3.jpg"><br><br>

<b><i>Step 5: Insert A Ramp</i><br></b>
Now we want the player to be able to send troops onto the top of the cliff. We need to use the terrain browser at the bottom to do this. Select the tileset "0025 Slope Set Pieces", and select the first tile in this set. Move your mouse to the cliff and when you are at the correct position, click. It should look like this:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_4.jpg"><br>
As this is only one part of the slope, we need to select the second tile in the tileset, and do the same procedure. Result:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_5.jpg"><br>
<br>

<b><i>Step 6: Make A Bridge</i><br></b>
Now we want to have another cliff that is connected to our first cliff by a bridge. First paint the second cliff like the first cliff (<i>Steps 1-4</i>). Place it to the right of the first cliff (not too far away). Then use the terrain browser similar to <i>Step 5</i> to paint the bridge heads (tileset "0019 Bridges"). This should be the result:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_6.jpg"><br><br>

<b><i>Step 7: Connect The Bridge Pieces</i><br></b>
As you see, we don’t have the bridge itself yet. To paint it use the object browser at the left. Click on the + next to Special/Overlay and then on the + next to bridges. Select the Big Bridge. Then move the mouse onto the mid of the first bridge head, and, while holding down the left mouse button, move it to the mid of the second bridge head. While dragging, this should be visible:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_7.jpg"><br>
After you release the left mouse button, the bridge will appear:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_8.jpg"><br>If you want to, you can use the terrain browser to place some streets to make it look better but that’s not really necessary for the map to work.
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 8: Make An Ocean</i><br></b>
The complicated parts are finished now. We will place some water now to divide the map into 2 areas. Use the object browser at the left and click on the + next to Ground. Then select water. We recommend using brush size 3 x 3 or bigger. Move the mouse where you want to place the water. You’ll see that FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> automatically creates the shore. Click with the left mouse button to place the water. It’ll look like this:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_9.jpg"><br>Continue placing water until the map is divided but leave a land passage so that the players can attack each other. 
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 9: Set Player Locations</i><br></b>
The overall map design is almost ready. We still have to set up the player locations. Begin by selecting Player locations in the object browser. We currently have 8 players on the map, but we want it to be a 2 player map. There are other ways to do it, but the best one is to place any player locations that are not needed next to the real starting location. To place a starting location, select the player and then click on the map. For our map, the area of the first starting location should look similar to this:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_10.jpg"><br>
Place the other starting locations at the other starting area.<br>
<b><u>Tip:</u> If you have at least Red Alert 2 1.006 or Yuri's Revenge, you should delete any starting locations you don´t need. So, for making a 2 player map,
you only place Player 1 and Player 2, and delete the other starting locations.</b>
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 10: Add The Ore</i><br></b>
We need ore! Without ore, the game would be a bit boring. To place ore, use Special/Overlay->Ore->Random ore at the object browser at the left. This tool uses the brush size, too. The result:
<br><br>
<img src="pics/tutorial1_11.jpg"><br>
If you want to place some ore mines, use Terrain Objects->Ore mines in the object browser.
<br><br>

<b><i>Step 11: All Done! Save Your Map!</i><br></b>
<i>That´s it!</i> You made your first map and it features the core elements of most professionally designed maps.  You can, of course, place some buildings, trees (under terrain objects), gems etc. but that’s not part of this particular tutorial. To play the map, use File->Save. The check map dialog will appear (it should not display any errors). Click on OK. Specify the filename (it must be a .mpr file) and click on OK. In the next dialog you can enter the map name as it will appear in RA2. You can also specify if a preview shall be saved.  Now start RA2 and start a new skirmish game. Select your map in the list. You’ll see that there are 8 player slots. Choose one enemy (as we have a 2 player only map). Now start the game.
