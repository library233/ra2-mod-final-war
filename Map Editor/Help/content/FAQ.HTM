	<p>	
  Here a list of the most frequently asked questions regarding FinalAlert 2 <font size=1>TM</font>:
<br><br>

  <br>
  <b>Q: </b>FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> crashes or doesn´t respond anymore while loading graphics<br>
  <b>A: </b>You should try switching to another color mode. More information about this in the Readme file.<br>
  <br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>I cannot reach the terrain behind a cliff!<br>
  <b>A: </b>If you have problems reaching certain parts of the map you can use the <a href="editt.htm">hide tile and hide tileset tools</a> to hide the cliff. Use the hide tile tool so that only the cliff parts you don’t want to see are hidden. You can now access the terrain behind this cliff part.
<br><br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>How can I make sandy or grassy terrain? The LAT tileset available just has a rect form?<br>
  <b>A: </b>Just use the LAT tiles. FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> will automatically smooth the terrain.<br><br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>How can I tile a large area, without having to paint everything myself?<br>
  <b>A: </b>A new function has been added to version 0.97 Alpha 2 to assist you. Select the tile to fill with in the terrain browser and then move the mouse cursor where you want to fill the area. Hold down CTRL and then press the left mouse button. Filling only works with the small tiles though (for example the LAT tiles and the small water ones). This makes sense, as filling with the same cliff tile produces weird results.
<br><br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>Why does Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge complain about a player maximum of 0 players?<br>
  <b>A: </b>In Multiplayer maps, the waypoints 0-7 define the starting points of the players 1-8. If you want, for example, to play with 4 players you need to set the waypoints 0, 1, 2 and 3.<br>
  <br>


  <br>
  <b>Q: </b>How can I set the starting points of the player(s)?<br>
  <b>A: </b>Use the starting points list in the Object Browser at the left of the Main Screen. Make sure you begin with player 1, then player 2 and so on (Do not leave players out. You can set player 3 before player 2 but player 2 must exist if player 3 exists).
<br>
  <br>


<br>
  <b>Q: </b>Why does my multiplayer map crash after loading?<br>
  <b>A: </b>You probably haven’t checked the multiplayer option in the new map dialog. To fix this, try the following:<br>
1) Click on File->New<br>    2) Multiplayer map<br>    3) Import Map<br>   4) Browse for your map<br>   5) Click OK<br>   6) Save the map as .mpr in the RA2 directory <br>
FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> will now automatically repair the map and produce a multiplayer map. Please note that any building and unit on the map should be given to the neutral/civilian player (or special/JP player). FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> does not do this automatically.

<br>
  <br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>How can I play my single player map?<br>
  <b>A: </b>Refer to the <a href="tutsp.htm">singleplayer tutorial</a></b><br>
  <br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>What are triggers?<br>
  <b>A: </b>Triggers are used to start certain events on the map. They consist of a general flags area, an event area and an action area. The flags area just sets the name of the trigger and some things like whether the trigger should repeat and who owns the trigger. The events define when this event shall occur. Finally, the actions define what happens if the events are true. Example: If time passed is 30 seconds, then send some units to the player.
<br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>I can´t see the trigger and other options in the edit menu?<br>
  <b>A: </b>You have beginner mode enabled. Disable beginner mode in the options menu.</a></b><br>
  <br>

<br>
  <b>Q: </b>Many sites require me to send a minimap preview together with the map. How can I make a minimap preview?<br>
  <b>A: </b>First, you´ll need a picture editing program that can save JPG files. Load your map in FinalAlert 2:Yuri's Revenge.
            Then select the minimap window and press ALT-Print on your keyboard. This will copy the minimap window into the clipboard.
            Now open your picture editing program and paste the clipboard contents. You´ll now see the minimap. You should remove
            the window border, if possible. Now, save your picture as JPG file. You might experience with quality settings.
            Now you just need to zip your map and preview file into one zip file. You should also put in a text file
            describing your map.</b><br>
