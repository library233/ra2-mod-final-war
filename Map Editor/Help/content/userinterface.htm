		4. User Interface
		</p>
	<p>	
		Before you jump in and create maps you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> User Interface. Note the Screenshot Below: 
		
		<br>
		<img src="pics/ui2.jpg">
		<bR>

		<u>Main Window Legend</u><br>		
		(1) 	Toolbars and menu<br>
		(2)	IsoView<br>
		(3)	ObjectView or Object Browser<br>
		(4)	Terrain and Overlay Browser<br><br>
		
		FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> consists of one Main Window. It is displayed after FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> has completed loading. In the Main Window you can<br>
	<table>
	<tr>
	<td width=50>
	</td><td>
	open a map<br>
	save a map<br>
	create a new one<br>
	modify general characteristics of the map<br>
	edit the terrain and the units <br>
	create and modify triggers, tags, teamtypes & taskforces<br><br>
	</td>
	</tr>
	</table>



 	We will concentrate on the IsoView. The largest part of the Main Window consists of the IsoView. 
	It shows the map. You can size the different windows inside the main window. 
	For example, hold down the mouse button on the thick line between the IsoView and the Terrain/Ground and 
	Overlay Browser (below the scrollbar of the IsoView). Move your mouse up or down and size the 2 windows as you need them. 
	It’s the same with the IsoView/Browser and the ObjectView.

The IsoView
</p>
<p>

Before you can use IsoView, you need to create a new map or load an existing one. You can scroll the IsoView by using the scrollbars. The "borders" of the map are in bright red. This means inside this rectangle is the "real" map. You should ignore the outside and no units should ever be set there. 
<br><br>
You should see your map now. If it’s a new map, it’s quite boring with only one ground type and no units (unless you imported a map). 2 icons need to be explained:
<br>
