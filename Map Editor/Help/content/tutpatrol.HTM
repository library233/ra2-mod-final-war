	17.  Creating a Patrol trigger  </p>
	<p>

Make sure you already understand what teamtypes, triggers, taskforces and scripts are before you do this tutorial.<br><br>

<b>Step 1: Placing the units to patrol</b><br><br>
We´ll make a 2 Conscripts and 1 Tesla Trooper patrol. So, place those units close to each other on the map.
Give them to the Russians using Change Owner. Make sure they are recruitable by double clicking on each.
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 2: Placing waypoints</b><br><br>
Place one waypoint close to the units. The other one should be placed where you want them to patrol to.
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 3: Create the taskforce</b><br><br>
Create a new taskforce and add 2 Conscripts and 1 Tesla Trooper
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 4: Create the script</b><br><br>
Create a new script. Add the following in exact order:<br>
1. Patrol to waypoint. Set waypoint to the first waypoint you created.<br>
2. Guard Area (timer ticks): 10 time units<br>
3. Patrol to waypoint. Set waypoint to the second waypoint you created.<br>
4. Guard Area (timer ticks): 10 time units<br>
5. Jump to line #: 1
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 5: Create the teamtype</b><br><br>
Create a new teamtype. Select your script and taskforce, and set waypoint to the first waypoint you created.
Make sure Autocreate is not checked and Recruiter <b>is</b> checked. Change Owner to Russia.
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 6: Create the trigger</b><br><br>
Create a new trigger. Select owner Russia. Select the event you want to have, for patrols this usually is Any Event.
As Action, use Create Team and select your created TeamType. 
<br><br><br>


That´s it! Easy, isn´t it?
