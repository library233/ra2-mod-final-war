Welcome Commander,<br><br>
I see that you have decided to proceed further in your tactical education.  It is obvious we agree that a mind is a terrible thing to waste. My teams of genetically enhanced scientists have been working diligently to provide you with a brand new version of Final Alert 2.  Here I present to you Final Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge™.  You may always download the latest version of the editor from <a href="http://www.westwood.com" target="_new">www.westwood.com</a>.   It is solely compatible with the Red Alert 2 expansion - Yuri's Revenge.<b> If you have acquired this editor but you do not have Yuri's Revenge then any maps that utilize Yuri's Revenge specific art will not work for you.  Please go and download the original Final Alert 2.</b><br><br>

I have generously included tutorials that will help you begin developing the ultimate battlefield. I would recommend that you utilize them or you will not fully develop your mind powers.  The main tutorial is located <a href="maptutorial.htm">here</a>. It demonstrates how to do a completely new multiplayer map with bridges, water and cliffs. It is very detailed, has many pictures (so your tiny mind may grasp the concepts) and therefore highly recommended. <br><br>

You might also try reading the <a href="faq.htm">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to expand your consciousness.  I can see, however, that your vanity will not allow you show weakness by using a tutorial.  So be it.
<br><br>

While we obviously fixed some bugs we also added a number of new features.  Below you will find a list of specific improvements for Final Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge.  Please make sure you review them.
