		4.  Multiplayer Map Tutorial		</p>
	<p>	

These missions can be played in Skirmish Mode and in a multiplayer game.
<br><br>

<i><b>Step 1: Create A New Multiplayer Map</b></i><br><br>
Create the map using File->New. Check the multiplayer box and click on OK. 
Select the appropiate options Enter the map size and theater, and press OK. FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> will automatically set up the map for multiplayer (except starting locations).
<br><br>
Now finish your map. After you have done this, you can place the starting locations.
<br><br><br>

<i><b>Step 2: Set Player Starting Locations </b></i><br><br>
Use the File->New function to create a new multiplayer map. Set the waypoints 0- x (x is smaller than 8) to set the starting location for players 0- x. You can use the starting locations tool in the object browser in order to do this. If you want to have 3 players, set waypoints 0, 1 and 2.
<br><br>
 
To play it, start TS/RA2, create a multiplayer/skirmish game and choose your map from the multiplayer map list (not by loading the map in the random map editor!) <br>
<b>Note:</b> You cannot define your own houses in multiplayer, this means if you want to create a preexisting enemy base you need to use the "Neutral" house and use triggers to give it to another player.
<br><br><br>

<i><b>Step 3: Auto and Manual Map </b></i><br><br>
Here are a couple of things to remember…<br><br>
Automatic map transfer (standard): This is the standard setting. It is turned on by Edit->Basic->Official set to "no". There are certain limitations to this: 
<br>
1. In an Internet game, there is a maximum transfer time. If it is reached, RA2 Yuri's Revenge will stop transferring and you won’t be able to play. This limit is 3 minutes.
<br>
2. Only applying if using RA2 before version 1.005: If you don’t have 8 starting locations (waypoints 0-7), then RA2 will sometimes decide to use some random starting locations. This means you (A) may set no starting locations and always let RA2 choose the starting positions or (B) you place all 8 waypoints. If you do it the second way in a 4 player map, for example, you just place 2 waypoints for each starting location right next to each other. RA2 will only use one of these starting locations, never both! You must  restrict the game in RA2 to 4 players in this example (do not choose 7 other enemies).
<br><br>

Manual Map Transfer: You can activate this by setting Edit->Basic->Official to "yes". To play the map with other people you have to send the map to everyone taking part in the game. Everyone must restart RA2 for the map to be recognized. The limitations for automatic map transfer do not apply, you only need 2 waypoints. 
<br><br>
Note: RA2 will not support transferred maps in Quick Match or Tournament Modes.<br>
