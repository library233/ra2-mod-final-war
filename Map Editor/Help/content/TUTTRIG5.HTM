	11.  Trigger & Tag Tutorial (Advanced)  </p>
	<p>

<b>Creating & Using Triggers and Tags</b><br><br>
In addition to events and actions triggers also have a structure called a tag associated with them. Tags are identifiers for the triggers; they tag them for use. The trigger editor with FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge <font size=1>TM</font> automatically sets up and handles tags for you, but it is important to understand their purpose to accomplish many tasks. One common such task is a trigger that will fire when an important unit is destroyed, such as Tanya.
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 1: Create A New Variable</b><br><br>
Trigger: Set up a local lose variable after Tanya is killed<br>
Create a new variable called "Tanya lost" using Edit->Local Variables
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 2: Create The Trigger</b><br><br>
Create a trigger with the following attributes:<br>
a. Name: "Tanya Killed"<br>
b. Event: "48 Attached object destroyed"<br>
c. Action: "56 Set local" parameter is the variable you created
<br><br><br>

<b>Step 3:  Adjust Tanya’s Attributes</b><br><br>
Place Tanya on the map under the human player's control. Double-click on Tanya to bring up her unit attributes. Now change the "Attached Tag" property to "01000001 Tanya Killed 1".
<br><br><br>

Simple, isn't it? Structures and vehicles can also be attached to a tag, in addition to any Teams you have created. This is how the player wins when the Kremlin is destroyed (same event "attached object destroyed") or after a paradropped Yuri is killed. Many actions also use tags, such as action 14, "Give attached objects to house".
