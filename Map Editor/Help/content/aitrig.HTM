		8.  AI Triggers
		</p>
	<p>	

AI Triggers are used by the game to decide which units AI players build in both singleplayer and multiplayer maps. Similar to normal triggers
they are based on a certain event. In contrast, the action is always building a team. While normal triggers often do not work
as expected in multiplayer maps, AI triggers can be used very good to achieve the same results.<br>
To use AI triggers you need to know how to make Taskforces, Scripts and Teamtypes which are covered in several tutorials in this manual.
You should read these tutorials before making AI triggers.<br><br>
Let´s take a look at the AI trigger editor:<br>
<img src="Pics/aitrig.jpg"><br><br>
This is an example for a typical AI Trigger. Let´s take a closer look at the different options:<br><br>
Enabled: Do not forget to check this if the AI trigger shall be used<br><br>
Type: This specifies the general event type for the AI Trigger. You can choose between several different types,
The selected one specifies that the house that accesses the AI trigger must have a certain amount of certain objects.
The exact amount, and the object type, is specified later on.<br><br>
Name: Just a descriptive name of the AI Trigger<br><br>
House: Usually this should be all, except you want only a certain house to access the AI trigger<br><br>
Teamtypes: They specify the teams that shall be created as result of the AI trigger<br><br>
Multi-Side: Specify if this trigger is for Everybody, Soviets, Allies or Yuri<br><br>
Base defense: If this is checked, this AI trigger may be used even if the house doesn´t have a hated enemy yet<br><br>
Available in Skirmish: Check this, and the AI trigger may be used in multiplayer games<br><br>
Easy, Medium, Hard: In which difficulty modes is this AI trigger available?<br><br>
Weight: Starting weight of the AI trigger. As higher, as more likely it is that the house decides to build the teamtype<br><br>
MinWeight: The minimum weight that this AI trigger must have<br><br>
MaxWeight: The maximum weight that this AI trigger can have<br><br>
For the AI trigger types 0, 1, 4 and 7 the following applies:<br><br>
Use Condition, Number and Unittype to select the values that are needed for the AI trigger to fire.
<br><br><br>
The AI trigger you see here does the following:<br>
Once the current enemy of the AI trigger house has at least 1 Allied Battle Lab, build the teamtype
"10 Apoc Attack Base". The AI trigger is useable by all Soviet houses in both singleplayer and 
multiplayer games, in all difficulty levels. Weight isn´t very high, so it may happen that the house
does decide that this AI trigger isn´t as important as other AI triggers and probably won´t fire it.
Note that the trigger will only fire if the house´s current enemy is Allied, as Soviet enemies
cannot have an Allied Battle Lab.
