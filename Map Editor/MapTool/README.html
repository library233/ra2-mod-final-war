<p>This program exists to apply conversion profiles, 'scripts' of sorts to map files from Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 and their respective expansion packs that offer ability to alter map's theater, tile, overlay and other object data, essentially allowing user to perform operations such as cross-theater, or even cross-game map conversions.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>As of current, MapTool only runs on Windows operating systems, with Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 as a requirement. Installation is simple, just place all of the required program files in a directory of your choice, and run it from there.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Using the graphical user interface (MapTool_UI.exe) should be fairly straightforward. If the program was installed correctly, available conversion profiles (conversion profiles are loaded from subdirectory called 'Profiles' in the program directory) should be displayed in a list for user to choose from, with a description for each of the profiles displayed next to the list if available. Maps can be added to the list of files to process by using Browse button or drag &amp; drop on the file list itself.</p>
<p>Instructions for the command line tool (MapTool.exe) can be found by running the program with argument -h (f.ex <code>MapTool.exe -h</code>).</p>
<p>MapTool_UI.exe can also be ran with the argument -log, which enables writing of full debug log file (which can get fairly large), and is passed to MapTool.exe.</p>
<p>Documentation on the contents of conversion profile INI files and how to write them can be found <a href="https://github.com/starkku/maptool/blob/master/Conversion-Profile-Documentation.md">here</a>.</p>
