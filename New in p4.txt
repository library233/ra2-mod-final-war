;changes in p4 (see previous changelog.txt for all these updates and all previous p3.5 and prior updates)

;general changes
- Shield logic has been implemented! In Final War, the usage of this logic will fall into EuroCoal 'Shields' seen on ATOMOS units that function similar to Protoss shields from Starcraft 2. Undecided usage but likely intended usage as follows: Explosive Reactive Armor is a reusable damage absorbsion technology that can be attached to armored units to give it additional protection, but only for one shot. Junk armor functions similar to Explosive Reactive Armor, but does not ever respawn or regenerate.
 - Shields are as follows and are referenced to unless unique:
  - T1 shields offer a 75 HP shield that regenerates 5% every 0.08 ingame minutes (respawns at 12% every 1 ingame minute)
  - T2 shields offer a 75 HP shield that regenerates 5% every 0.10 ingame minutes (respawns at 15% every 1 ingame minute)
  - T3 shields offer a 75 HP shield that regenerates 5% every 0.12 ingame minutes (respawns at 20% every 1 ingame minute)
  - T4 shields offer a 75 HP shield that regenerates 5% every 0.06 ingame minutes (respawns at 25% every 1 ingame minute)
 - Explosive Reactive Armor has been implemented! ERA levels are as follows and are referenced to unless unique:
  - T1 ERA offers 1 HP 'shield' that absorbs all damage dealt above the 'shield' HP that respawns once every 2 minutes
  - T2 ERA offers 1 HP 'shield' that absorbs all damage dealt above the 'shield' HP that respawns once every 1.75 minutes
  - T3 ERA offers 1 HP 'shield' that absorbs all damage dealt above the 'shield' HP that respawns once every 1.5 minutes
 - Junk Armor has been implemented! Junk armor is a 1 HP 'shield' that absorbs all damage dealt above the 'shield' HP that only works once

- Added several new resource tools, none of these are featured on any current maps and exist for mappers to use (there are labels for FA2):
  - Hematite has been introduced to the project. A grey-like resource, this ore is refined for irons used in almost all production. This resource is worth the mid-way point between Ore and Gems, at 40 credits per 'bale' and a 30% slower generation and spread chance than normal ore. (Ore is worth 25/bale, Gems are worth 55/bale)
  - Three new Ore drills have been added to the game with modified graphics indicating their purpose. ORETRE01-03 can be found under the  ORETRE01 is a normal ore drill, just with new graphics. ORETRE02 is an ore drill capable of generating resources 2 cells away from the drill and generates an additional patch of ore when it generates, and ORETRE03 is an ore drill capable of generating resources 2 cells away from the drill and generattes an additional 3 patches of ore when it generates.
  - Three new Gem drills have been added with modified Ore drill graphics to indicate their purpose. GEMTRE01-03 can be found under the Terrrain objects, GEMTRE1 is a normal Ore drill that generates Gems instead, GEMTRE02 and GEMTRE03 are Gem versions of ORETRE02 and ORETRE03.
